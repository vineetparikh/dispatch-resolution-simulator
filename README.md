# Dispatch Resolution Simulator

This site is a (hurriedly put together) basic implementation/simulator of the main resolution mechanic in [Dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispatch_(video_game)), a game about dispatching superheroes to solve problems on the fly. 

## Building and running the simulator
This is deployed on Github Pages, but if you'd like to run it yourself:
- clone the repo via `git clone`
- cd into the repo and `npm install` all the dependencies (this uses React + Vite and some other libraries to help with simulating the polygon)
- `npm run dev` to get a local dev instance running
- To deploy

## Why I made this (TODO: to expand)

Most critical acclaim about the game thus far focused primarily on the narrative TellTale-style gameplay, animation, voice acting, and characters, which makes sense: these are all really good! 

I however think the actual dispatch gameplay, especially the core resolution mechanic, is underappreciated at the moment and is actually pretty groundbreaking for future RPG-style games. I'll expand more on this in hopefully a future commit that can also be added to the design rationale section.

## Contributing and feedback

This is pretty minimal, so I'd appreciate feedback on what modifications people might like to see (and especially would appreciate PRs if people have feature ideas). This is also a relatively small side project though, so I may not be able to get to things anytime soon.
